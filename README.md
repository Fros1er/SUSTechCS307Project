### Interface Specification


The structure of the interfaces is as follows.

- `database` folder stores connection information such as username, password, url, we only provides `PostgreSQL` as the DBMS.
- `dto` folder stores a set of data objects that will be accessed by interfaces. Your implementation will use them as parameters or returned values.
- `service` folder stores **Service Interfaces**, this is the folder you should pay special attention to. There exist multiple `.java` file where the interface signatures are stored. You need to implement you own `class` to fit these signatures.
- `exception` folder stores exceptions that you should `throw` if something went wrong.
- `factory` folder stores the `ServiceFactory` abstract class that you need to implement to create your service instances.

### Your Tasks

- Implement the `service` and `factory` interfaces to pass the base testcases.
- Design your (PostgreSQL) database to satisfy the requirements of interfaces.
- Profile your implementation and find ways to speed it up.
- (Optional) Find other ways to implement similar functionalities as our interfaces and compare (some of) them, are they better, worse or have different use cases. 

Here is a reference implementation, it shows you how to implement one method of an interface. To get a service working, you'll have to implement **all its interfaces**

*The following code is just a guide, the code interacts with database will usually be written in the DAO layer*

```java
@ParametersAreNonnullByDefault
public class ReferenceStudentService implements StudentService {
    /* Some codes are omitted */
    @Override
    public void dropCourse(int studentId, int sectionId) {
        try (Connection connection = SQLDataSource.getInstance().getSQLConnection();
            PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement("call drop_course(?, ?)")) {
            stmt.setInt(1, studentId);
            stmt.setInt(2, sectionId);
            stmt.execute();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    /* Some codes are omitted */
}
```

```java
public class ReferenceServiceFactory extends ServiceFactory {
    public ReferenceServiceFactory() {
        registerService(StudentService.class, new ReferenceStudentService());
        registerService(CourseService.class, new ReferenceCourseService());
        // registerService(<interface name>.class, new <your implementation>());
    }
}
```

**After you have implemented your factory class, be sure to put your factory class name into the file `./config.properties`. So that we can find your implementation and test.**

```
serviceFactory=your.package.YourServiceFactory            // Your factory class name here.
jdbcUrl=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/project2
username=postgres
password=postgres
```

### Tips

Please create database with `C` locale, which provides the platform-independent sorting result.

Here is a sample commands:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE project2 WITH ENCODING='UTF8' LC_COLLATE = 'C';
```

### Additional requirements of interface

#### Java
- All `add*()` functions with int as return value should return the (presumably auto-generated) ID.
- All arguments are guaranteed to be non-null, unless marked as @Nullable.
- All return values (and their fields) should be non-null, unless explicitly documented otherwise. If a list/map is
  empty, put List.of()/Map.of() or equivalents instead of null.
- Do **NOT** modify anything in the provided interfaces, or any of the framework code.
- Your implementation should throw `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException` if a method is not actually implemented,
  so the tests can fail quickly.


### Rules

- Data should be persisted on disk after each write operation instead of only modified in RAM. If you introduced a cache
  layer, you have to enforce the consistency. You should also ensure the durability in case of a sudden shutdown.
- You should **NOT** use frameworks such as **ORM**.
- You don't need to spend time on **GUI/WEB**, as we do **NOT** give extra scores for them.

#### Java-specific rules

- You should **NOT** modify or add any class in package `cn.edu.sustech.cs307`. Use another package for your
  implementations.
- You should **NOT** extend any class in package `cn.edu.sustech.cs307.dto`.
- In this project, we use Maven to manage dependent libraries. If you want to introduce a new library, you need to
  record it in `pom.xml`. Your dependencies should be downloadable from the Maven Central repository.



## 2. What to deliver?

- **PASS BASE TEST:** First and foremost, you should pass the base testcases, this is the basic requirement.

- **IMPROVE YOUR EFFICIENCY:** After you passed the base tests, you need to find ways to improve the performance of your implementation. You can work on the following aspects.

    #### Resource Consumption

    - Memory Consumption: How much memory your database takes?
    - Disk Consumption: How much disk space your database takes? How are they distributed? (index, data, other info?)

    #### Speed

    - Data Import Speed: How much time your database need to import all data?
    - Data Modify Speed (Insertion, Update, Deletion): How much time your database need to change one/one hundred/one million rows?
    - Data Query Speed: How much time your database need to fetch one/one hundred/one million rows?
    - Cache Policy: How much time your database need to fetch a row if the row was just accessed by others?

    #### Concurrency

    - Simultaneous Query Number: How many queries can your database handles simultaneously?
    - Simultaneous Query Latency: How long does it take to query if there are many users connect to your database simultaneously.
    - Transaction Safety: Is your database safe with many users concurrently writing/reading to it?

    #### Correctness

    - Malformed Data Identification: Can your database identify the malformed data automatically?
    - ACID Principle


- **(Optional) DIFFERENT WAYS SAME GOAL?** Can you find other ways to implement these functionalities? Are they **BETTER/WORSE/USECASE-RELATED?** Please do share us your amazing ideas.
